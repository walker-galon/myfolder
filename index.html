                    <h1>Can We Manufacture Water Out of Thin Air?</h1>
                    <p>
                        ­­Water is becoming an increasingly important issue in the 
                        developed world. But this issue is nothing new for other, 
                        less developed nations. For centuries, clean drinking water
                        has been hard to come by for many populations, especially 
                        those in impoverished nations. In some areas, water may be 
                        available, but it's often disease-ridden, and drinking it can
                        be fatal. In other areas, a viable water supply is sim­ply not 
                        available at all.<br><br>
                        According to the World Health Organization, more than 
                        2 billion people live in water-stressed countries, and 
                        that number is expected to increase in some regions because
                        of climate change and population growth. This leads us to
                        wonder: Since the world needs clean water so badly, why
                        can't we jus­t make it?<br><br>
                        ­Water is made of two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen 
                        atom. This seems like pretty basic chemistry, so why don't
                        we just smash them together and solve the world­'s water ills? 
                        Theoretically, this is possible, but it would be an extrem­ely
                        dangerous process, too.<br><br>
                        To create water, oxygen and hydrogen atoms must be present.
                        Mixing them together doesn't help; you're still left with 
                        just separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The orbits of each
                        atom's electrons must become linked, and to do that we must
                        have a sudden burst of energy to get these shy things to
                        hook up.<br><br>
                        ­Since hydrogen is extremely flammable and oxygen supports
                        combustion, it wouldn't take much to create this force. 
                        Pretty much all we need is a spark — not even a flame — and 
                        boom! We've got water. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms'
                        electrons' orbits have been conjoined.<br><br>
                        But we also have an explosion and — if our experiment was 
                        big enough — a deadly one. The ill-fated blimp, the Hindenburg,
                        was filled with hydrogen to keep it afloat. As it approached 
                        New Jersey May 6, 1937, to land after a trans-Atlantic voyage,
                        static electricity (or an act of sabotage, according to some) 
                        caused the hydrogen to spark. When mixed with the ambient 
                        oxygen in the air, the hydrogen exploded, enveloping the 
                        Hindenburg in a ball of fire that completely destroyed the 
                        ship within half a minute. <br><br>
                        There was, however, also a lot of water created by this 
                        explosion.<br><br>
                        To create enough drinking water to sustain the global
                        population, a very dangerous and incredibly large-scale
                        process would be required. Still, more than a century ago 
                        the thought ­of an internal combustion engine — with its 
                        controlled repeated explosions — seemed dangerously mad. 
                        But as water becomes scarcer, the process of joining hydrogen 
                        atoms to oxygen atoms may become more attractive than it
                        is currently. Necessity, after all, is the mother of
                        invention.<br><br>
                        But there are safer ways of creating water out of thin air,
                        and projects to do just that are already underway.<br><br>
